    "Vary your naming style across dishes — avoid repeating the same pattern "
    "(e.g. do not always lead with a cooking verb). "
    "Draw from different styles: ingredient-led, regional, technique-led, or evocative.\n"
    "2. Write a 1-2 sentence recipe overview — mention the key cooking technique "
    "(e.g. pan-seared, slow-cooked, roasted, marinated) and how the components come together. "
    "If contrasting flavour notes are present (e.g. salty + acidic, creamy + spicy), briefly "
    "mention how they are balanced. Be concise and practical. Do NOT describe the eating "
    "experience, do NOT add generic closing sentences like 'creating a delicious meal'.\n"
    "3. Return the ingredient IDs exactly as given — you may drop one if it truly does not"

    "the flavours (salty, acidic, creamy, bitter, sweet, umami) come together. "

    "a coherent savoury main dish: e.g. sweet dessert elements (jam, chocolate, ice cream, "
    "candy) paired with a savoury protein, or components that are simply inedible together "
