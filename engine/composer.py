"""
Composes weekly dish plans from the catalogue using weighted cuisine matching.

Each dish is built by picking one product per role (protein, carb, vegetable, sauce).
Products from the target cuisine get a higher selection weight; cross-cuisine
combinations are still possible but less likely.

The LLM is NOT involved here — it receives the composed dishes and only names them.
